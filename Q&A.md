1. Answer : A

Explanation : In this code, there's a typo in the variable name. It should be greeting instead of greetign. Since greetign is not defined, JavaScript treats it as an undeclared variable, and it won't throw a ReferenceError. Instead, it creates a new global variable greetign and assigns an empty object to it. So, the correct answer is option A, which prints an empty object {} to the console.

2. Answer : C

Explanation : JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means it performs implicit type coercion. In this case, when you add a number (1) to a string ("2"), JavaScript converts the number to a string and concatenates them, resulting in "12". So, the correct answer is option C.

3. Answer : A

Explaination : In this code, the food array is not modified directly. Instead, a new object named info is created with a property named favoriteFood, and it initially references the first element of the food array, which is "üçï". However, when the info.favoriteFood property is reassigned to "üçù", it doesn't affect the original food array. So, the correct answer is option A, and the food array remains as ['üçï', 'üç´', 'ü•ë', 'üçî'].

4. Answer : B

Explaination : The sayHi function expects a name parameter, but when you call it without passing any arguments (sayHi()), the name parameter is undefined. Therefore, the function returns "Hi there, undefined". So, the correct answer is option B.

5. Answer : C

Explaination : The forEach method iterates over the nums array and executes the provided callback function for each element. In JavaScript, 0 is considered a falsy value, while all other numbers are truthy. So, for each element in the array except 0, the if (num) condition is satisfied, and count is incremented by 1. Therefore, the final value of count is 3, and the correct answer is option C.
